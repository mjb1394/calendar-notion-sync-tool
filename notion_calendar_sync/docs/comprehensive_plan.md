# Comprehensive Plan for Expanding Notion API Integration and UI/UX Improvement

## Objectives
1. Expand the functionality of the Notion API connected app.
2. Significantly improve the aesthetics and UI/UX of the Flask app while maintaining a modern futuristic appearance.

## Tasks

### Notion API Integration
- **Enhance Sync Functionality**:
  - Improve the `SyncEngine` to handle more complex synchronization scenarios.
  - Implement error handling and logging for sync operations.

- **Weekly Review Feature**:
  - Enhance the `create_weekly_review_page` function to include more detailed summaries and insights.
  - Allow users to customize the content of the weekly review.

- **Spaced Repetition Feature**:
  - Improve the `schedule_spaced_repetition` function to allow for more flexible scheduling options.
  - Add user-defined parameters for repetition intervals.

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Templates**:
  - Revamp the existing templates in `apps/flask/templates/` to create a more cohesive and modern design.
  - Ensure all templates are responsive and user-friendly.

- **CSS Enhancements**:
  - Update `main.css` in `apps/flask/static/css/` to incorporate modern design trends (e.g., gradients, shadows, animations).
  - Ensure consistent styling across all pages.

- **JavaScript Enhancements**:
  - Improve interactivity using JavaScript in `main.js` located in `apps/flask/static/js/`.
  - Implement AJAX calls for smoother user experiences during sync operations.

## Files to be Edited
- `notion_calendar_sync/apps/flask/templates/*.html` (all template files)
- `notion_calendar_sync/apps/flask/static/css/main.css`
- `notion_calendar_sync/apps/flask/static/js/main.js`
- `notion_calendar_sync/sync/core.py`
- `notion_calendar_sync/features/weekly_review.py`
- `notion_calendar_sync/features/spaced_repetition.py`

## Follow-Up Steps
1. Review the current implementation of the Notion API integration.
2. Implement the planned changes incrementally, testing each feature as it is developed.
3. Gather user feedback on the new UI/UX design and functionality.

## Conclusion
This plan outlines the steps necessary to enhance the Notion API integration and improve the overall user experience of the Flask app. The focus will be on creating a modern, functional, and aesthetically pleasing application for university nursing students.
